# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Features
User registration: Users can create an account by providing an email and password. The password is securely hashed using bcrypt before storing it in the user database.

User authentication: Registered users can log in using their email and password. The application verifies the provided credentials against the stored hashed password.

URL shortening: Logged-in users can create shortened URLs for any long URL they want to share. The application generates a unique short URL and associates it with the user's account.

URL management: Users can view, edit, and delete their shortened URLs. They can also access the original long URL by clicking on the short URL.
